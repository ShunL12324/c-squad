# Changelog

Release dates use UTC. This file starts with the verified v0.7.0 and v0.7.1
release history; earlier releases remain available on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ShunL12324/c-squad/releases).

## v0.8.0 — 2026-09-21

### Added

- Configure Claude Code and Codex launchers independently with
  `engine_commands.<engine>.executable` and literal fixed `args`. For example,
  `cfuse --cc` can receive the existing Claude Code arguments.
- Opt into Bash or Zsh for persistent aliases, including aliases with leading
  environment assignments. Startup checks, doctor, engine launches, and helper
  commands use the configured launcher. Arguments retain spaces, quotes, and
  shell metacharacters literally.

### Changed

- Team resume reloads engine command defaults from current configuration;
  member restart and recovery retain the saved command configuration.
- Preserve explicit environment overrides after shell initialization, then
  apply alias-local assignments. Without an explicit PATH override, retain
  directories added by the shell rc file and put the member's bound C-Squad
  launcher first.
- Clarify layout, confirmation, and acknowledgment comments; remove redundant
  conditions and helpers; separate task operations and panel UI responsibilities.
- Brief sends Master a short English native user prompt asking for task progress,
  remaining work, and blockers, with a direct reply in the user's language.
  It no longer creates team messages, ACK/reply chains, or outbox retries.
  Each deliberate click is a new question; older Brief records remain audit-only.

### Fixed

- npm installations now show a one-time interactive completion setup hint. Run
  `csquad completion install --shell zsh`, then execute its printed loading line
  in the current Zsh and add the same line at the end of `~/.zshrc`, after any
  completion framework. Direct registration handles missing `fpath` entries and
  old compinit caches without deleting caches or editing startup files for users.
- npm automation, completion protocol calls and agent panes remain quiet. The
  setup hint stays suppressed across upgrades and Node-prefix switches; installed
  completion files remain in user-owned storage after npm uninstall. Installation
  alone does not activate completion in an already-open shell.

## [v0.7.1](https://github.com/ShunL12324/c-squad/releases/tag/v0.7.1) — 2026-09-21

- Make routine message acknowledgments optional while retaining explicit ACK,
  reply, retry, and Brief commands.
- Preserve successfully sent messages across restart and recovery without
  automatic redelivery or missing-ACK warnings.
- Skip sent messages during sync and conservatively migrate known legacy
  acknowledgment warnings.
- Update shared English prompts to keep routine progress in the ledger and
  follow up when the context requires it.

## [v0.7.0](https://github.com/ShunL12324/c-squad/releases/tag/v0.7.0) — 2026-09-21

- Add tmux-style `new -s NAME` and clarify team lifecycle commands.
- Preserve member panel geometry across navigation and resize, including task
  overlays.
- Record independent user confirmation separately from technical task completion.
- Aggregate task reports and suppress duplicate or stale notifications.
- Preserve explicit member environment overrides and validate resumed launch
  context.
- Use shared English runtime prompt templates.
- Add explicit task workspace cleanup with preview and safety checks, without
  background forced cleanup.
